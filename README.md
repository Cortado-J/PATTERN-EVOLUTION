# PATTERN-EVOLUTION

A minimal p5.js project for pattern evolution experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The canvas will display a circle that follows your mouse cursor

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with p5.js library loaded from CDN
- `sketch.js` - p5.js sketch with setup() and draw() functions
- `style.css` - Basic styling for the canvas

## Development

This project uses p5.js version 1.7.0 loaded from CDN. No build process is required - simply open the HTML file in a browser to run the sketch.
